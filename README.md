# EPAi3-Session13

### Project
For this project you are given a file that contains some parking ticket violations for NYC.
For this sample data set, the file is named:

nyc_parking_tickets_extract.csv Your goals are as follows:

### Goal 1
Create a lazy iterator that will return a named tuple of the data in each row. The data types should be appropriate - i.e. if the column is a date, you should be storing dates in the named tuple, if the field is an integer, then it should be stored as an integer, etc.

### Goal 2
Calculate the number of violations by car make.

Note: Try to use lazy evaluation as much as possible - it may not always be possible though! That's OK, as long as it's kept to a minimum.
